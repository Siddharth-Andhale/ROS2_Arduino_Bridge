# ROS2_Arduino_Bridge
This repository contains the necessary code and instructions to create a ROS2 bridge between a Jetson Nano running ROS2 Foxy and an Arduino Mega controlling a Cytron MDD10A motor driver. The setup allows you to control motors connected to the Cytron MDD10A via ROS2 commands sent from the Jetson Nano to the Arduino Mega through a serial connection.
